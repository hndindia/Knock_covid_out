    <string name="FAQ_Q1">Q1-What is a coronavirus?</string>
    <string name="FAQ_Q2">Q2-What is COVID-19?  </string>
    <string name="FAQ_Q3">Q3-Who is at risk of developing severe illness?  </string>
    <string name="FAQ_Q4">Q4-How does COVID-19 spread? </string>
    <string name="FAQ_Q5">Q5-Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? </string>

    <string name="FAQ_A1"> Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. </string>
    <string name="FAQ_A2"> COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. </string>
    <string name="FAQ_A3">  While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.   </string>
    <string name="FAQ_A4"> People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. </string>
    <string name="FAQ_A5"> Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?” </string>

    <!--***For Symptoms****-->
    <string name="RunnyNose">
                            A runny nose is excess nasal drainage. It may be a thin clear fluid, thick mucus or something in between.
            But runny nose is not the only/exactly a symptom of COVID-19
                </string>
    <string name="Headache">
                        Headache is the symptom of pain in the face, head, or neck. It can occur as a migraine, tension-type headache, or cluster headache.
                </string>

    <!--***************************-->

    <!--***For Precaution****-->
    <string name="washHands">
                        Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one\'s hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
                </string>
    <string name="DoNotTouchYourFace">
                    Avoid touching the face again and again because it is one of the reason for fast trasmission of COVID-19 virus to trasmit into lungs.
                </string>
    <string name="AvoidSickPeople">
                    in hospitals, doctors are avoiding shaking hands so that to stop the transmission of germs/viruses from sick people, so avoid shaking hands, hugs and talk making one meter distance to sick people.
                </string>
    <string name="StayInHome">
                    Preparing for coronavirus (COVID-19) means having what you need to stay home. Officials are asking people to only go out when absolutely needed so they don\'t get sick. Keeping your household supplied will prevent you from running out of essentials.
                </string>
    <string name="KeepYourMouthCovered">
                    The idea is to cover your mouth when you cough (or sneeze) so the germs in your body are not propelled into the air or across the room, which could make others sick.

    <string name="MaintainCleanliness">
                    With the help of cleanliness, we can keep our physical and mental health clean, which will make us feel good.
